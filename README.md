- [crosslink-advanced](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-crosslink-advanced) - adds commands to deal with [ftags](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-lazy-cached-vault-load?tab=readme-ov-file#wait-a-minute-what-are-folderindex-notes-what-are-ftags-what-do-you-mean-annexed)-oriented vaults: add ftags, create child note, open random unftagged file, etc.
- [virtual-dirs](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-virtual-dirs) - adds "virtual" folder files / folder indexes. You can open them, you can search for them, but they do not take space and "materialise" whenever you want a _real_ folder note

## Contributing

Issues and patches are welcome. This plugin is intended to be used with other plugins and I would try to do my best to support this use case, but I retain the right to refuse supporting any given plugin for arbitrary reasons.
